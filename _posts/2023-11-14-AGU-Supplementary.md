Welcome! If you made it here, you probably saw my poster at AGU. Below is a short narrative about the kind of data that we are collecting that I could not fit into the poster. Please reach out to me (paul_seibert@berkeley.edu) if you have any questions. 

At our site, we mount a SIF imager on a tripod to create hyperspectral images, as shown in the figure below.

From this imagery we are able to observe solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized differnece vegetative index (NDVI), and near-infrared vegetative reflectance (NIRvR) with fine spatial resolution (on the order of centimeters or less). Below is an example of the kinds of images we can create at a single point in time.

With the [current call for proximal remote sensing](https://eos.org/science-updates/ecosystem-observations-from-every-angle) to understand the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem productivity, this kind of imagery is extremely valuable and may lead to a re-structuring of the way we understand photosynthesis across landscapes.
