In 2021 I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering from the 
University of Maryland, College Park. I moved to the west coast to attend the University of California, Berkeley and get my Master's of Science degree in Environmental Engineering. In 2022, I graduated with my MS from UC Berkeley and began conducting research under the supervision of [Dr. Cynthia Gerlein-Safdi](https://twitter.com/cgerleinsafdi?lang=en). I am also part of the UC Berkeley environmental fluid mechanics and hydrology group [(EFMH)](https://ucb-efmh.github.io/efmh-site/index). In my free time, I like to climb rocks, play guitar, and cook new dishes.
