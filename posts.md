[International Fog and Dew Conference](_posts/2023-09-12-fog-and-dew.md)


# Fog and Dew Conference 07-2023

In July 2023 I went to the [International Conference on Fog, Fog Collection, and Dew](https://fogdew2023.org/) in Fort Collins, Colorado. While there, I presented a poster that showed the results of a recent greenhouse fogging experiment that I have been working on. In this experiment, I fogged grasses overnight with deuterated water to quantify foliar uptake (how much fog are they using overnight).

I also met the leading world experts studying the formation, collection, and quantification of both fog and dew. 

Some interesting and useful information from the conference: 
* Fog and dew *are different* since dew forms directly onto a surface (thus involving a phase change) where fog **does not**
* Fog != mist. Mist has larger water droplets, and usually is defined as a condition reducing visbility to 1-2 kilometers
* There is no internationally recognized standard for potential dew, although there are efforts to remedy this
* The National Weather Service defines at least [7 different types of fog](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/fog_stuff/fog_definitions/Fog_definitions.html)
* What is fog? The international community seems to disagree on an exact definition. There are three main ways that people seem to define "fog":
  1. Fog is a cloud that is touching the surface of the Earth (or close to it)
  2. Fog is a meteorological condition that reduces visibility to less than 1 kilometer
  3. Fog is (definition 1) with a mean droplet size between 10 and 100 microns (this seems like the least practical definition)
